# ft_printf
The printf project is our own implementation of the printf function in the C programming language. The printf function is widely used for formatted output of data to the standard output stream. In this project, we create our own version of the printf function, including handling various data types, special formatting characters, and variable arguments. This project helps to understand the principles of printf function operation and improve C programming skills.
